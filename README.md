# Bitcoin Price Prediction

This project uses an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) deep learning model to forecast future Bitcoin prices based on historical data.

## 📌 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Keras / TensorFlow
- Scikit-learn

## 💡 Highlights
- Preprocessing of time series data
- LSTM neural network model
- Training and evaluation on BTC dataset
- Visualization of predicted vs actual prices

## 📁 File
- `Bitcoin_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Main notebook with full model pipeline

## 🧠 Result
The LSTM model is able to capture temporal dependencies and provide directional trends in Bitcoin's price.
